# Request-For-Coupon
Offer discounts only to few customers who request for it. Declaring a general discount plan would be of high risk. Once done, bouncing back to normal prices could be hard if the discount time period is limited or your income is not comfortable. Uncertain pricing can not be trusted, and when prices are lower because of a discount, customers could get the opinion that you are able to produce the same quality of work for less money. If a current or potential customer thinks this, then convincing them to pay the full price will be difficult.
